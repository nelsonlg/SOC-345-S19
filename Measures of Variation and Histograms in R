THE CHUNK BELOW HAS CODE FOR LOOKING AT MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY, MEASURES OF VARIATION, AND HISTOGRAMS TO THINK ABOUT 
THE SHAPE OF THE DISTRIBUTION FOR THE VARIABLE HOMPOP. 
**FOR THE HISTOGRAM, YOU MUST FILL IN 2 COLORS, A TITLE, AND LABELS FOR THE Y-AXIS AND X-AXIS.

#Previously we looked at bar charts and bar graphs, which are graphs of either nominal or ordinal level variables, where
#the 'bins' are seprated by a space, and the height of the bars is proportional to the frequency or percentage in each category. #
#Histograms, on the other hand, are visual representations of interval-ratio level data. 

ggplot(data = GSS, aes(x = hompop)) + geom_histogram(color="blue ", fill="white ", binwidth =1, aes(y=(..count../sum(..count..))*100)) + 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 15, 1)) +
ggtitle("Distribution of Members of a Household amond Adult Americans, GSS ") + 
labs(y="Percent ", x="Household members ") 
```
1) Write a sentence that interprets the mean and standard deviation.
2) What is the shape of the distribution (symmetrical, positively skewed, negatively skewed)? Explain your 
answer using measures of central tendency and describing key points from the histogram.

3) Write a sentence that interprets the mean and standard deviation.
4) What is the shape of the distribution (symmetrical, positively skewed, negatively skewed)? Explain your 
answer using measures of central tendency and describing key points from the histogram.

5) On average, would you say that it common to have many unrelated people living in a household in the U.S.? Explain. Also, would you say
that households in the U.S. are relatively small or large, on average? Explain.
6) Is there more variability in the number of people living in a household or in the number of unrelated 
people living in a household in the U.S.? Explain your answer using measures of variation and describing 
key points from the histograms.
