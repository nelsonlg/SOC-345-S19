THE CHUNK BELOW HAS CODE FOR LOOKING AT MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY, MEASURES OF VARIATION, AND HISTOGRAMS TO THINK ABOUT 
THE SHAPE OF THE DISTRIBUTION FOR THE VARIABLE HOMPOP. 
**FOR THE HISTOGRAM, YOU MUST FILL IN 2 COLORS, A TITLE, AND LABELS FOR THE Y-AXIS AND X-AXIS.

1) What is the variance? How is it related to the standard deviation? 
2) Write a sentence that interprets the mean and standard deviation.
3) What is the shape of the distribution (symmetrical, positively skewed, negatively skewed)? Explain your 
answer using measures of central tendency and describing key points from the histogram.

4) Write a sentence that interprets the mean and standard deviation.
5) What is the shape of the distribution (symmetrical, positively skewed, negatively skewed)? Explain your 
answer using measures of central tendency and describing key points from the histogram.

6) On average, would you say that it common to have many unrelated people living in a household in the U.S.? Explain.
7) Would you say that households in the U.S. are relatively small or large, on average? Explain.
8) Is there more variability in the number of people living in a household or in the number of unrelated 
people living in a household in the U.S.? Explain your answer using measures of variation and describing 
key points from the histograms.
