Graphing a nominal variable -- divorce -- with NA (missing) values.
```{r}
library(aws.s3)
library('lehmansociology')
library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')
s3load('gss.Rda', bucket = 'lehmansociologydata')
#THE LINE OF CODE BELOW GIVES YOU A "BARE BONES" BAR GRAPH THAT INCLUDES 'NA' WHICH WE DO NOT WANT.
ggplot(data = GSS, aes(x = divorce)) + geom_bar()

#NOTE THAT THE + AT THE END OF THE LINE TELLS R TO CONTINUE READING ON THE NEXT LINE
ggplot(data=subset(GSS, !is.na(divorce)), aes(x=divorce)) + 
geom_bar(color="green", fill="white", aes(y = ((..count..)/sum(..count..)))) + 
ggtitle("Figure 1. Bar Graph of the Distribution of Divorce among Adult Americans") + 
labs(y="Percent", x="Ever Divorced") 
```

HERE IS AN EXAMPLE FOR A HISTOGRAM FOR THE VARIABLE NAMED tvhours: 
```{r}
ggplot(data = GSS, aes(x = tvhours)) + geom_histogram(color="orange", fill="white", binwidth =1, aes(y=(..count../sum(..count..))*100)) + 
ggtitle("Figure 3. Distribution of Adult Americans by Hours per Day Spent Watching TV") + 
labs(y="Percent", x="Hours per Day") 
```
THINK ABOUT WHICH PIECES OF THE CODE YOU CAN/SHOULD REPLACE TO GENERATE GRAPHS FOR YOUR OWN VARIABLES: 
VARIABLE NAME (find and replace), 
COLORS (outline colors and or fill colors; type the same color name if you want solid color),
TITLE (edit inside of double quotation marks; use Title Case, proper spelling, etc.; be clear, accurate, and describe the graph),
LABELS (called labs; edit inside of the double quotation marks; use Title Case, proper spelling, etc.; be clear, accurate)
BINWIDTH for histograms (described in swirl lesson; often, you want to use binwidth=1)


NOTE: THE CHUNK BELOW LOOKS AT MEASURES OF VARIABILITY
```{r}
summary(GSS$childs, na.rm=TRUE)
IQR(GSS$childs, na.rm=TRUE)
var(GSS$childs, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(GSS$childs, na.rm=TRUE)

summary(GSS$chldidel)
IQR(GSS$chldidel, na.rm=TRUE)
var(GSS$chldidel, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(GSS$chldidel, na.rm=TRUE)

summary(GSS$hrs2)
IQR(GSS$hrs2, na.rm=TRUE)
var(GSS$hrs2, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(GSS$hrs2, na.rm=TRUE)

summary(GSS$tvhours)
IQR(GSS$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE)
var(GSS$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(GSS$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE)
```
Is there more variability in American's ideal number of children or in the number of children that Americans have? 
What does this tell you about Americans' behaviors and opinions?

Can you compare the number of hours spent working and spent watching tv? Which has greater variation?
