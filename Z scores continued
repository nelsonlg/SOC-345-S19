Now let's create some new variables where instead of the actual values we have the difference from the value to the mean, divided by the standard deviation of the original variable. 
This is known as the z-sxore for each individual respondent's reported hours of TV watched daily. Then we will get the histogram for each new variable.


```{r}
GSS$tvhours0<-(GSS$tvhours - mean(GSS$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE))/(sd(GSS$tvhours, na.rm = TRUE))
summary(GSS$tvhours0, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(GSS$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot_tvhours0 <-ggplot(GSS, aes(tvhours0))
ggplot_tvhours0 + geom_histogram(binwidth =1, aes(y=(..count../sum(..count..))*100)) + 
    ggtitle("Distribution of TV Watching by Adult Americans (Recentered Variable), GSS") +   
    labs(y="Percent",     x="Hours of TV Watched Daily, Recentered") + 
    geom_vline(xintercept=mean(GSS$tvhours0, na.rm=TRUE),  color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=.5) 
```

```{r}
GSS$tvmins <-GSS$tvhours*60
GSS$tvmins0<-(GSS$tvmins - mean(GSS$tvmins, na.rm=TRUE))/(sd(tvmins, na.rm=TRUE))
summary(GSS$tvmins0, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(GSS$tvmins, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot_tvmins0 <-ggplot(GSS, aes(tvmins0))
ggplot_tvmins0 + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth =60, aes(y=(..count../sum(..count..))*100)) + 
    ggtitle("Distribution of TV Watching (Minutes per day) by Adult Americans (Recentered variable), GSS") +   labs(y="Percent",     x="Minutes of TV Watched Daily, Recentered") + 
    geom_vline(xintercept=mean(GSS$tvmins0, na.rm=TRUE),  color="green", linetype="dashed", size=.5) 
```

ANSWER THESE:

What does a negative value on these variables mean?  

When we convert the value of an observation into units of "standard deviations above the mean" 
or "standard deviations below the mean" those new scores are called Z-SCORES.

What is the mean for a set of observations equal to the z-score?
