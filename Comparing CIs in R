Write an interpretation of the CI around the proportion of childless males. Remember to be specific about how we infer about our population parameter from our sample statistic. 
Be specific with the language, say something along the lines of: "I can be 95% confident that the true population proportion of childless males in the US is between ..." 
Write an interpretation of the CI around the proportion of childless females.

The chunk below gets the CI around the Mean of tvhours for different groups.
```{r}
#get mean for different groups with the code below
aggregate(GSS$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE, by=list(GSS$race), mean)

#to get the CI around the mean of tvhours for race groups separately, you can select out a race group using the dplyr package, which you added to your libraries for this lab.
#the line of code below "filters out" whites and creates a temporary dataset named White 
White<-dplyr::filter(GSS, race=="White")
#the variable value in quotation marks at the end of the line of code above is case sensitive.
#notice that the line below uses temporary dataset called White (created above) instead of GSS and that White is case sensitive
ciMean(White$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE, conf =0.95)

#the code below separates out "Other" race and gets CI around mean of tvhours for this group
Other<-dplyr::filter(GSS, race=="Other")
ciMean(Other$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE, conf =0.95)
```
ADD CODE TO THE CHUNK ABOVE TO GET THE CI AROUND MEAN OF TVHOURS FOR BLACK AMERICANS.
Write an interpretation of the CI around the mean of tvhours for white, black, and other race Americans.
