Write an interpretation of the CIs you got in the chunk above. 
In interpreting confidence intervals, remember to be careful about the language. Write something along the lines of: "I can be 95% confident that the true population mean of hours of TV watched daily by adult Americans is between ...."
Comparing the 90%, 95%, and 99% CIs, do you see any differences?


```{r}
#dichotomize a variable and get confidence interval around proportion
GSS$nochild <-as.numeric(GSS$childs) == 0
frequency(GSS$nochild)
mean(GSS$nochild, na.rm = TRUE)
#90% CI proportion of childless adults
ciMean(as.numeric(GSS$nochild), na.rm=TRUE, conf =0.90)
#95% CI proportion of childless adults
ciMean(as.numeric(GSS$nochild), na.rm=TRUE, conf =0.95)
```
Write an interpretation of the CIs you got in the chunk above.
Remember to be specific with your language. 
Write something along the lines of: "I can be 95% confident that true population proportion of adult Americans with no children is between ...."
#working with another dichotomous variable
```{r}
#look at a dichotomous variable in the GSS
frequency(GSS$sex)
frequency(as.numeric(GSS$sex))
```
Notice how R assigns numeric values 1 for male and 2 for female. 
Is that okay for our purpose of getting a CI around the proportion?
Explain what needs to be done to the variable sex to get the confidence interval around the proportion of males.

```{r}
GSS$male<-(as.numeric(GSS$sex)) ==1
frequency(GSS$male)
mean(GSS$male)
```
ADD CODE TO THE CHUNK ABOVE TO GET THE 95% CI AROUND THE PROPORTION OF MALES.

Why do you think I named the variable above 'Male?'
