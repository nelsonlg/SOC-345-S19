**CHUNK 1 STARTS BELOW THIS LINE.
```{r}
#YOU WILL ALWAYS NEED THIS FIRST CHUNK. WE WILL ADD TO IT DURING THE SEMESTER.
#THIS CHUNK LOADS THE LIBRARIES AND DATA THAT YOU NEED FOR YOUR WORK.
library(aws.s3)
library('lehmansociology')

s3load('gss.Rda', bucket = 'lehmansociologydata')
s3load('gss100.Rdata', bucket = 'lehmansociologydata')
```

**CHUNK 2 STARTS BELOW THIS LINE.
BELOW WE WILL GET FREQUENCY TABLES AND MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY FOR VARIABLES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MEASUREMENT.
```{r}
frequency(GSS$race)
summary(GSS$race)
#Note: MODE needs to be capitalized, which is uncommon. Most of the time, commands will be lower case.
MODE(GSS$race)
```
WRITE 1-2 SENTENCES BELOW THAT INTERPRET THE RESULTS THAT YOU GET FROM RUNNING THE CHUNK ABOVE. 
HOW DO THE RESULTS FOR SUMMARY DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS FOR FREQUENCY?


```{r}
frequency(GSS$health)
frequency(as.numeric(GSS$health))
#WRITE A NOTE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ADD as.numeric --WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RESULT FOR THE TWO LINES ABOVE?
summary(GSS$health)
MODE(GSS$health)
median(as.numeric(GSS$health), na.rm=TRUE)
```
WRITE 1-2 SENTENCES BELOW THAT INTERPRET THE RESULTS FROM RUNNING THE CHUNK ABOVE. 
HOW DO THE RESULTS FOR SUMMARY DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS FOR FREQUENCY? 
EXPLAIN WHY YOU NEED TO INCLUDE as.numeric AND na.rm=TRUE TO GET A MEDIAN FOR THIS VARIABLE AND 
EXPLAIN HOW YOU INTERPRET THE RESULT YOU GET WHEN YOU RUN THE LINE OF CODE FOR THE MEDIAN.


```{r}
frequency(GSS$childs)
summary(GSS$childs)
MODE(GSS$childs)
median(GSS$childs, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(GSS$childs, na.rm=TRUE)
```
WRITE 1-2 SENTENCES BELOW THAT INTERPRET THE RESULTS THAT YOU GET FROM RUNNING THE CHUNK ABOVE. 
EXPLAIN WHY YOU NEED na.rm=TRUE. EXPLAIN TO YOURSELF WHICH COMMANDS GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED, WHICH COMMANDS YOU MIGHT NOT NEED, ETC.
